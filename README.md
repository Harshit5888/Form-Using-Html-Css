# Form-Using-Html-Css
To create a form, you start by creating an HTML file and adding a form tag to it. Inside the form tag, you can add various input elements to collect different types of data, such as text, email, password, number, and others. You can also add checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus using the select tag.
